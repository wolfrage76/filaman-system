# Display API — build your own dashboard or digital swatch board

`GET /api/v1/display` is a read-only feed of every printer FilaMan manages: each
AMS unit, each slot, and the filament in it (colour, material, manufacturer,
remaining amount), plus a small printer/job summary. It exists so you can build
a wall display, an e-paper swatch panel, a tablet kiosk or a Home Assistant card
without knowing anything about FilaMan's internals or the printer driver.

FilaMan ships a reference client at `/display`, listed in the sidebar as
**AMS View** (a full-screen swatch board that runs in any browser). Read its
source in `frontend/src/pages/display.astro` — it uses nothing but this
endpoint.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/display` | All active printers |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/display/printers/{id}` | One printer, same envelope |

Query parameters:

- `fields=full` (default) — everything below.
- `fields=slots` — only what a swatch board needs (id/name/state/active + per slot:
  `slot, label, empty, active, color, material, remaining_percent, spool_id`).
  A two-AMS printer is well under 2 KB; fine for a microcontroller.

## Authentication

Any principal holding the `display:read` permission:

- a logged-in browser session (the kiosk page uses this),
- a personal API key,
- **a registered device** — register your panel like a scale (Admin → Devices),
  give it the `display:read` scope, and send `Authorization: Device <token>`.

Users and viewers get `display:read` by default.

## Polling cheaply

The response carries an `ETag`. Send it back as `If-None-Match`; if nothing on
the board changed you get `304 Not Modified` with no body. Poll every 3–10 s.

```
GET /api/v1/display?fields=slots
If-None-Match: W/"9f2c…"
Authorization: Device 12.34.abcdef…
```

Rules you can rely on:

- Numbers are raw. No pre-formatted strings, no thresholds — decide "low" yourself.
- `color` is always a 7-char `#RRGGBB`. Alpha is stripped.
- A regular AMS always lists slots 0–3, even when empty. An AMS-HT lists slot 0; the external holder lists as many trays as the printer reports (labels `Ext1`, `Ext2`, …).
- `spool_id` is set only when FilaMan has a spool assigned to that slot; a slot
  can still be non-empty (the printer sees filament) with `spool_id: null`.
- Adding fields never bumps `schema_version`; changing a field's meaning does.

## What the feed is built from

1. **FilaMan's slot assignments** — which spool is in which slot. This works for
   every printer, with any driver, and yields colour/material/remaining from the
   spool record.
2. **The driver's live state (optional)** — a driver may implement
   `get_display_state()` on its `BaseDriver` subclass to add tray contents as the
   printer sees them, job progress, temperatures, drying and the active slot.
3. **The driver's health, as a fallback** — a driver without that hook still
   reports `health()`, and `connected` plus the AMS `ams_units` it carries are
   enough for the online badge and for per-unit temperature, humidity and
   `model` (from an entry's `module_type` or `info`). So
   every driver contributes something; without the hook, `job`, `temperatures`
   and `state` stay `null` and the board is still complete.

Driver authors: return either the normalised shape documented in
`app/services/display_service.py::normalize_driver_state`, or a Bambu-style
status dict — both are accepted. Keep it cached; it is called on every poll.
For `model`, pass an AMS unit's `info` hex string on as the printer sent it, or
Bambuddy's `module_type` (`ams`, `n3f`, `n3s`); either one is enough.

### Freshness across workers

FilaMan runs several Gunicorn workers, but a printer driver lives in the primary
one only. The primary publishes what it sees into shared memory and every other
worker serves that snapshot, so any worker can answer a poll. The price is that a
value can be a few seconds behind: harmless for temperature and humidity, briefly
visible on the active bay right after a filament change. A driver that is stopped
drops out of the snapshot at once rather than lingering.
